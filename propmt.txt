i have written python code which performs some blast opretions on ncbi to fetch seq similar to user input and later it compares to ncbi databases with ref seq by user input seq and find mutation and also find mutation table for particular acession no. and also returns pubmed papers according to acession no.s and also have chat bot which asnwers basic genome questions like what is brca1 and what it causes? and so i i have done it with gork model but all this codes are in different python program and written on streamlit i dont have one combine platform which mangage all at single time like automated service like when user input .fasta seq it should perform blast automatically and when user type that he wants find its mutations then it should automatically compare with ref seq and also provides some mutational diagrams with its positions i allso have this code and if user type i want references about it then user should find references automatically fetched from pubmed "Choose a model",
