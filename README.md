   ```
   Trigger ‚Üí HTTP Request (BLAST) ‚Üí HTTP Request (Mutation) ‚Üí Format Results
   ```

2. **Literature Review Workflow**:
   ```
   Gene List ‚Üí For Each ‚Üí PubMed Search ‚Üí Summarize ‚Üí Email Report
   ```

### RAG System Enhancement
Add custom knowledge:

```python
from genomics_rag import GenomicsRAG

rag = GenomicsRAG()
rag.add_pubmed_abstracts(your_abstracts)  # Add literature
rag.populate_custom_genes(your_gene_data)  # Add gene info
```

### Extending Agents
Add custom agents in `genomics_agents.py`:

```python
custom_agent = AssistantAgent(
    name="ProteinStructureAgent",
    system_message="Analyze protein structures and domains...",
    llm_config=llm_config
)
```

1. **BLAST Timeout**: Increase timeout in BLAST functions
2. **Model API Errors**: Check your model endpoint configuration
3. **Memory Issues**: Reduce agent conversation history
4. **Database Errors**: Ensure ChromaDB permissions

### Logs
Check logs in:
- FastAPI: Console output

5. **Security** (HTTPS, API keys, rate limiting)

## Support

For issues or enhancements:
1. Check existing analysis logs
2. Review API documentation at `/docs`
3. Test individual components separately
4. Consider fallback modes for critical functions

## üí° Tips for Best Results

### üéØ Getting Better Chat Responses
- **Be specific**: "Analyze BRCA1 mutations" vs "Tell me about genes"
- **Use context**: Upload sequence first, then ask questions
- **Ask follow-up questions**: "Explain that result in more detail"
- **Combine requests**: "Analyze this sequence and find related literature"

### üß¨ Sequence Analysis Tips
- **Valid formats**: FASTA, raw sequence (DNA/RNA: ATCG, Protein: standard amino acids)
- **Sequence length**: Longer sequences (>50bp) give better BLAST results
- **Quality check**: Remove ambiguous characters (N, X) if possible
- **Context matters**: Mention species, gene name, or source if known

### üìö Literature Search Tips
- **Use gene symbols**: "BRCA1" instead of "breast cancer gene 1"
- **Add keywords**: "BRCA1 mutations breast cancer treatment"
- **Ask for summaries**: "Summarize recent CRISPR research"
- **Request specific info**: "What are clinical guidelines for BRCA testing?"

### üîç Interpretation Help
- **Ask for explanations**: "What does this E-value mean?"
- **Request context**: "Is this mutation clinically significant?"
- **Get recommendations**: "What experiments should I do next?"
- **Compare results**: "How does this compare to normal variants?"

### üöÄ Advanced Usage Examples
```
"I uploaded a BRCA1 sequence. Please analyze it for mutations, 
find recent literature on clinical significance, and explain 
what this means for patient care."
```

```
"This BLAST result shows 98% identity. What does this mean? 
Is this sequence from human or another organism?"
```

```
"Compare this protein sequence to known oncogenes and 
suggest functional studies to characterize it."
```
